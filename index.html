        How can we meaningfully evaluate ubiquitous computing (UbiComp) systems and ensure their performance, trustworthiness, and societal relevance? As the field increasingly incorporates complex AI models, real-time sensing, and human-centered applications, responsible evaluation has become more critical than ever. Yet, evaluation in UbiComp remains fragmented—often system-specific, ad hoc, or limited to narrow metrics and lacking standardized benchmarks. This workshop contends that we cannot improve what we cannot measure, and seeks to establish a community-wide dialogue around evaluation practices. From a technical perspective, we will explore new methods, metrics, and benchmarks that account for uncertainty, generalization, and adaptation in dynamic real-world environments. From a human-centered perspective, we will discuss how to evaluate usability, trust, and interpretability in context-aware systems. From a social and ethical perspective, we will question what we should evaluate, and for whom—beyond traditional performance metrics. EvalComp aims to lay the groundwork for a long-term, interdisciplinary agenda focused on building robust, reflective, and reproducible evaluation frameworks for UbiComp. By launching this workshop, we seek to create a dedicated space for shaping the future of evaluation in the community.
        EvalComp 2025 will be hosted at
        <a href="https://www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp-iswc-2025/">UbiComp 2025</a> and will bring
    together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to explore versatile
        topics related to fairness and robustness in ubiquitous computing.
