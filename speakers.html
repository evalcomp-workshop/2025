        <!--<p><b>Title:</b> Robustness and Fairness: Do they go hand in hand? Exploring machine learning robustness and fairness in ubiquitous computing</p>
        <p><b>Abstract:</b> The notion of fairness in machine learning has been deeply investigated by many researchers, with many definitions of algorithmic fairness have been made available in the literature. However, the generalisability of these methods remains an open problem, particularly to different data qualities. The ability of generalisation to different data qualities can also be referred to as robustness. Current fairness mitigation strategies, however, have largely been observed only in model training. We have studied various fairness mitigation strategies under the presence of noise, and discovered methods that are sensitive to noise and conversely also those that are more robust and can still produce fair outcomes under noisy or perturbed data. Although this research has only been conducted on benchmark datasets, I will argue why this is widely applicable to the ubiquitous computing domain, and with wide implications in wearable, mobile and ubiquitous computing systems. I will share some of our recent work leveraging self-supervised learning for ML robustness in ubiquitous computing applications. I will also share some initial (unpublished) ideas on how both robustness and fairness can potentially be observed hand in hand. I would very much welcome discussions at the end on collaboration, as ideas are plenty, but we need more hands on deck to ensure that we can minimise disparity and improve robust and safe algorithms for the end users and stakeholders of UbiComp systems. </p>
