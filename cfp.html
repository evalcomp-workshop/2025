      <h2>Workshop Theme and Goals</h2>
      <p>

        We aim EvalComp to be an interdisciplinary forum beyond publications’ solicitation that brings together academia and industry. 

In particular, the goal of this workshop is to collaboratively: 
        <strong>Assess</strong> the evolving socio-technical challenges and concerns around evaluating foundation models and generative AI in ubiquitous technologies, including domains such as health sensing, mobility, context-aware interaction, and behavioral computing; 
        <strong>Map</strong> the landscape of evaluation risks and opportunities—spanning input modalities, learning paradigms, deployment settings, and cultural contexts; 
        <strong>Envision</strong> new evaluation paradigms that reflect real-world performance, fairness, robustness, and alignment across diverse and multimodal data; 
        <strong>Explore</strong> novel methodologies for benchmarking, auditing, and human-in-the-loop evaluation, with a focus on generalization, uncertainty, and emergent behavior; \textit{Start} an interdisciplinary discourse on what meaningful and responsible evaluation looks like in the age of foundation models; and finally, 
        <strong>Consolidate</strong> a global community of researchers and practitioners committed to shaping responsible evaluation practices through shared infrastructure, collaborative studies, and future funding opportunities.\\

<!--         We aim EvalComp to be an interdisciplinary forum beyond just presenting papers, 
        where we can bring together academia and industry. 
        Notably, we reach out to researchers and practitioners whose work lies within the ACM SIGCHI domains
         (e.g., UbiComp, HCI, CSCW), as well as FAccT, ML & AI, Social sciences, Philosophy, Law, Psychology, and others.
        The workshop organizers are actively engaged in the aforementioned themes and will encourage their network of colleagues and students to participate.
        In particular, the goal of this workshop is to collaboratively: 
        <strong>Assess</strong> the evolving socio-technical themes and concerns in relation to fairness across ubiquitous technologies, ranging from health, behavioural, and emotion sensing to human- activity recognition, mobility, and navigation.
        <strong>Map</strong> he space of ethical risks and possibilities regarding technological interventions (e.g., input modalities, learning paradigms, design choices).
        <strong>Envision</strong> new sensing and data-acquisition paradigms to fairly and accurately gather ubiquitous physical, physiological, and experiential qualities.
        <strong>Explore</strong> novel methods for generalization, domain adapta- tion, and bias mitigation and investigate their suitability for diverse ubiquitous case studies.
        <strong>Initiate</strong> a discourse around the future of “ubiquitous fairness” and co-create research agenda(s) to meaningfully address it.
        <strong>Consolidate</strong> an international network of researchers to further develop these research agendas through funding proposals and through steering future funding instruments. -->

        <p> Topics of Interest}} \\
\noindent EvalComp aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and civil society to rethink how we comprehensively evaluate all aspects of foundation models, including LLMs and GenAI, especially as they are integrated into ubiquitous computing contexts. We invite submissions across a range of formats—technical papers, work-in-progress, evaluations-in-the-wild, toolkits, benchmarks, position papers, and provocations. Submissions are encouraged but not limited to the following topics:
        <ul>
          <li>Novel evaluation frameworks, metrics, and protocols for foundation models and GenAI beyond conventional metrics (e.g., coherence, alignment, fairness, robustness, uncertainty)</li>
          <li>Evaluation of LLMs and generative systems in ubiquitous and multimodal environments (e.g., mobile, wearable, ambient computing, sensor fusion)</li>
          <li>Generalization and robustness under distribution shifts, personalization, and adversarial or real-world conditions</li>
          <li>Evaluation of emergent behaviors and unintended capabilities (e.g., hallucinations, misuse, model drift, over-reliance)</li>
          <li>Comparative evaluation across foundation models (e.g., zero-shot vs. fine-tuned, proprietary vs. open-source)</li>
          <li>Human-in-the-loop and participatory evaluation methods (e.g., co-creation, lived experience, subjective utility, auditing)</li>
          <li> Context-aware evaluation datasets and testbeds for real-world domains (e.g., health, mobility, education, accessibility)</li>
          <li>Evaluation of alignment and value adherence (e.g., cultural sensitivity, goal consistency, instruction following)</li>
          <li>Social and ethical dimensions of evaluation (e.g., privacy, representational harms, misinformation, inclusivity, bias detection)</li>
          <li>Tools, benchmarks, and infrastructure for reproducible, scalable, and community-driven evaluation</li>
          <li>Cross-cultural and multilingual evaluation across diverse geographies and population groups</li>
          <li>Evaluation challenges in edge, low-resource, or privacy-sensitive deployments (e.g., differential privacy, on-device evaluation)</li>
          <li>Implications of regulatory frameworks and standards (e.g., EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF) on evaluation design and reporting</li>
        </ul>
