      <h2>Workshop Theme and Goals</h2>
      <p>
        We aim FairComp to be an interdisciplinary forum beyond just presenting papers, 
        where we can bring together academia and industry. 
        Notably, we reach out to researchers and practitioners whose work lies within the ACM SIGCHI domains
         (e.g., UbiComp, HCI, CSCW), as well as FAccT, ML & AI, Social sciences, Philosophy, Law, Psychology, and others.
        The workshop organizers are actively engaged in the aforementioned themes and will encourage their network of colleagues and students to participate.
        In particular, the goal of this workshop is to collaboratively: 
        <strong>Assess</strong> the evolving socio-technical themes and concerns in relation to fairness across ubiquitous technologies, ranging from health, behavioural, and emotion sensing to human- activity recognition, mobility, and navigation.
        <strong>Map</strong> he space of ethical risks and possibilities regarding technological interventions (e.g., input modalities, learning paradigms, design choices).
        <strong>Envision</strong> new sensing and data-acquisition paradigms to fairly and accurately gather ubiquitous physical, physiological, and experiential qualities.
        <strong>Explore</strong> novel methods for generalization, domain adapta- tion, and bias mitigation and investigate their suitability for diverse ubiquitous case studies.
        <strong>Initiate</strong> a discourse around the future of “ubiquitous fairness” and co-create research agenda(s) to meaningfully address it.
        <strong>Consolidate</strong> an international network of researchers to further develop these research agendas through funding proposals and through steering future funding instruments.

        <h2>Submission
        details</h2>
        <p>
          We invite complete and ongoing research works, use cases, field studies, review, as well as position papers between 4-6 pages (excluding references). Submission should follow UbiComp's publication vendor <a href="https://www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp-iswc-2024/authors/formatting/">instructions</a>, and submitted through <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions">PCS</a>.
          Specifically, the correct template for <strong>submission</strong> is double-column Word Submission Template or double-column LaTeX Template, and the correct template for <strong>publication</strong> (i.e., after conditional acceptance) is single-column Word Submission Template or double-column LaTeX template.
          Each article will be reviewed by 2 reviewers from a panel of experts consisting of external reviewers and organizers. To ensure accessibility, all authors should adhere to SIGCHI's <a href="https://sigchi.org/conferences/author-resources/accessibility-guide/">Accessible Submission Guidelines</a>.
          All accepted publications will be published on the workshop website and the ACM Digital Library as part of the UbiComp 2024 proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper needs to register for the conference and the workshop itself. During the workshop, each paper will be presented in-person by one of the authors.
        </p>

      <p><strong>All papers need to be anonymized</strong>. Any
        questions should be mailed to faircomp.workshop [AT] gmail.com.
